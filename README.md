## Chronomancer

**Chronomancer** is a minimalist, playful frontend web app that features:

- A **digital-style clock** showing the exact local time
- A **"day cycle" clock** that wobbles and gives an approximate sense of time
- A **fortune drawer** that shows a random message from a list of 200 fortunes

Built to explore frontend development with a creative twist.

## Why This Exists
